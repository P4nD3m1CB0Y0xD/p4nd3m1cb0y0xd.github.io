This space is where I document my ongoing journey through the darker, low-level corners of cybersecurity. You’ll find explorations into **reverse engineering**, **malware behavior**, **threat hunting** methodologies, **cyber threat intelligence (CTI)**, and the occasional **CTF challenge** for fun.

My goal is to break down how modern attacks evolve, how adversaries think, and how their tools operate beneath the surface. If you’re interested in understanding the mechanics behind threats, uncovering hidden behaviors, or sharpening your analysis skills, you’re in the right place.
