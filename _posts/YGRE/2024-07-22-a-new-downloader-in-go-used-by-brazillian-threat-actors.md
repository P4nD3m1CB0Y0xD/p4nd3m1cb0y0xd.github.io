# Key Finds:

- During our hunt section, we identified what looks like a new downloader written in the Go programming language, which was employed by Brazilian threat actors.
- Based on our information and data so far, this new downloader has existed since 06/20/2024.
- The second stage of this threat appears to be the Ousaban banking trojan, but this assumption is not very trustworthy.
- Based on this new malware, we can assume that Brazilian threat actors are experimenting with new technologies to apply to their infection chain.

# Introduction

This threat delivered its payload by sending a phishing [[T1566](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/)] email to the victim. The email contained a link to a cloud storage provider, Azure Blob Storage.

After a victim clicks on the malicious link, a zip file is downloaded to the target computer. From what we observe, this malicious archive follows a name similar to:

- `docx<9 random number>.zip`
- `ação<9 random number>.zip`

If a victim extracts the content of the zip file, an executable (the Golang downloader) follows a similar nomenclature but with a `“` symbol at the end of the nine random numbers.

- `ação<9 random number>".exe`

Using a fuzzing hash like TLSH and creating a simple query to search for similar files in VirusTotal, it was possible to identify other eight similar samples 

`tlsh:T1CCB6BF47EC9545A9C0EEA230C9B292977A717C495B3123D32B90F73D2F76BD06AB9340 AND entity:file tag:overlay engines:redcap AND sigma_rule:157ee4e95270f64481c50464c0e4766830e1e2b38b214a98f9e3f977857c6c69`

**Obs:** This sigma rule was used because this sample performs a reboot of the target system to set its persistence.

By taking our suspicious file to our lab environment, it was possible to desiccate this threat.

# Digging into their minds

Performing a simple triage in the binary reveals that the time stamp was changed [[T1070.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/006/)]. Malware authors commonly use this as a basic anti-forensic technique. We also see that this binary targets just x64-bit systems. 

The final thought that is taken from this is a suspicious binary overlay. This suggests that it may be packed (this was just part of my hypothesis process during the analysis).

Collecting simple information about the binary

Another good observation is that this go binary isn’t stripped, which means we can see a lot of information, like function names.

Open the sample in IDA and jump into the `main_main` function; we will start desiccating this sample to extract all kinds of intelligence.

![Untitled](/assets/images/YGRE/Untitled%202.png)

In this first block of assembly code, just by reading the function names that IDA recovers, we can assume that it will just create a directory named `Microsoft.NET\assembly\tangeu` into the user’s directory. In the very beginning, we also see a call to `time.Sleep` function, probably to slow down the execution into the sandbox.

After creating the directory, the malware generates a 10-length random string to use as a name for a zip file that will be placed in the `Microsoft.NET\assembly` directory.

The next action performed by this malware is to decode its config. The encoding process employed is very simple: `base64 → xored (key: psdql)`

After writing a simple Python script to decode its config, the output result is:

```python
import base64

def b64decode_xor(data: str, key: bytes) -> bytearray:
    try:
        cipher_text = base64.b64decode(data)
    except Exception as e:
        return None
    
    bKey = bytes(key)
    cipher_text = bytearray(cipher_text)
    for i in range(len(cipher_text)):
        cipher_text[i] ^= bKey[i % len(bKey)]

    return cipher_text.decode()

def main() -> None:
    encoded_data: list[str] = [
    "GAcQAR9KXEsGGwddBx4BFQEHGAMZFwEQABkJBRUDXhALHEMHHBYVQgoaFA==",
    "M0k4IR4fFBYQAVA1DR0JAy8wHhwRCUQ+KjQvMxAeAxIT",
    "GAcQAR9KXEsSAx0WFhIFHwEBBwMcBgcQA14QCxxDHhwSEEMTEgkUHhFdFBkcTwEICVE=",
    "IxwCBRsRAQEtIRkQFh4fHxUQLTsZHQAeGwMvJwQeAhYKBToVARcYAx4vNgQC"
    ]
    xor_key: bytes  = b"psdql"

    for data in encoded_data:
        print(b64decode_xor(data, xor_key))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

```
Output results:
>>> https[://]www[.comercioidealizado.]com/word.zip --> Second stage

>>> C:\Program Files\Topaz OFD\Warsaw --> Path to Topaz software

>>> https[://]comerciorevolucao[.]com/nova/camera.php?rlx= --> C2 domain

>>> Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run --> Persistence place
```

After decoding its config, the malware performs a request to the `https[://]www[.comercioidealizado.]com/word.zip` to download its second stage and extract the content from the zip file to the `tangeu` directory and execute the command: `shutdown /r /t 90` to reboot the system with the message.

Finally, the malware just set its persistence into the hive `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` with a random name pointing to the legitimate executable `textr.exe`, an OCR software from `ASCOMP Software GmbH` used to perform a DLL Side Loading [[T1574.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/)]. The malicious DLL used is named as `NsBars.dll`. By searching its hash into VirusTotal, we see that this is a Delphi binary packed with VMProtect.

After this, I shift my focus to reverse engineering the Go binary. The full source code can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/P4nD3m1CB0Y0xD/YouGotReversed/tree/main/Golang/Downloader/04-07-2024).

# Conclusion

Based on our analysis, we probably discovered a new downloader written in Go used by Brazillian threat actors to change their infection chain. This shows us the continues evolution in the Brazilian threat landscape.

We also reverse-engineered the binary and tried to recreate a similar code employed by the threat actor. You can check at my Github.
