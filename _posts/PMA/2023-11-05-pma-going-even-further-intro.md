# Introduction
So, what is this all about? Is this another post about the answers for the labs? Well, yeah! But I want to go even further and try to "compile and link" other areas, such as C/C++ programming, Revese Engineering, and Threat Intelligence, in one project.

This will be a series where I'll reconstruct the binaries from the labs, create Yara rules, and develop my researcher skills!c

This book is from 2012, written by Mychael Sikorski & Andrew Honing. But even though it is an old book, the topics and exercises it provides are very rich.

If you want to buy this book, you can find it on Amazon.

# Objectives
In this serie will have some objectives that are:
- improve our reverse engineering skills
- improve our programming skills
- improve our malware analysis skills
- improve our Yara writing skills
- and some other stuff

# Conclusion
The next post will start by digging into the Lab01. See you there.
